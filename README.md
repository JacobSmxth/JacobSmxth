## üöÄ About Me
I'm a Systems Programmer and Cybersecurity student at UNG Dahlonega, double-majoring in Cybersecurity & Computer Science. After switching to Linux, I transitioned from front-end development to low-level systems work. I have solid C expertise and 16-bit assembly fundamentals, and I‚Äôm currently focused on mastering C to fully understand systems internals, memory, and compilation. I also work with Go, C#, and Python, and rely on Neovim, Zsh, Git/GitHub, and QEMU for daily development and emulation workflows.

## üîß dotfiles

I maintain a public [dotfiles](https://github.com/JacobSmxth/dotfiles) repository
that centralizes my shell configs, Hyprland setup, and Waybar/Mako theming.
Leverage it to bootstrap your own environment or see how I architect my dev workspace.
