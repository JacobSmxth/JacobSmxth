## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm a Systems Programmer and Cybersecurity student at UNG Dahlonega, double-majoring in Cybersecurity & Computer Science. After transitioning to Linux, I pivoted from front-end web development to low-level systems work. I possess solid C expertise (with 16-bit assembly fundamentals) and am rapidly upskilling in Rust to one day build an open-source OS. I also dabble in Go, C#, and Python, using Neovim, Zsh, Git/GitHub, and QEMU for development and emulation workflows.
