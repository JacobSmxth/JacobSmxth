# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jacob Smith!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science and Cybersecurity **sophomore** at the University of North Georgia (UNG), with a keen interest in Financial Technology (FinTech). My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovative software solutions as a Software Engineer, particularly within the FinTech sector at companies like Fiserv.

As a Code Ninja Sensei, I've honed my abilities to break down complex concepts, lead initiatives, and ensure successful outcomesâ€”skills I'm excited to apply in professional software development.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Focused On: Building Secure & Scalable Financial Applications

I'm actively expanding my expertise to develop robust, high-performance, and secure software systems. My current learning and project focus is heavily geared towards the technologies that power modern financial services.

### ðŸ’» My Core Technical Toolkit:

My strongest languages are **JavaScript** (especially for web development) and **Go** and **Python** (for backend systems and scripting). I'm also rapidly strengthening my proficiency in Java and SQL for enterprise-grade applications.

* **Languages & Frameworks:**
    * **JavaScript (Proficient):** ReactJS (Hooks, component-based architecture, routing), Node.js (server-side applications and APIs)
    * **Go (Strong):** Concurrency (Goroutines, Channels), Microservices, System Programming
    * **Python (Strong):** Scripting, Data Processing, Web Development (Flask/Django), API Interactions
    * **Java (Developing Expertise):** Spring Boot, Enterprise Applications, Object-Oriented Design, JPA/Hibernate
    * **SQL (Developing Expertise):** Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle), Advanced Queries, Data Manipulation, Transaction Management
    * **Familiar With:** C (foundational understanding in systems programming and memory management)
* **Web Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Tailwind CSS
* **Tools & Concepts:**
    * **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
    * **Software Design:** RESTful API Design, Data Structures & Algorithms
    * **Methodologies:** Agile Development
    * **Security:** Secure Coding Practices (OWASP Top 10)
    * **Cloud:** Basic Cloud Concepts (AWS/Azure/GCP)
    * **Testing:** Unit & Integration Testing

### ðŸ’¡ Projects & Future Endeavors:

My personal projects are designed to demonstrate practical application of my skills, with a focus on real-world scenarios in software engineering and FinTech.

* **Secure Personal Finance Management System:** Developing a robust backend API (Java Spring Boot) for managing financial transactions, with secure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) and database integration (SQL). Planned features include user authentication, account creation, transaction logging, budget setting, and reporting. A ReactJS frontend is also envisioned.

* **Payment Processing Simulator:** Building a high-concurrency payment simulation system (Go) to understand transaction flows, error handling, and performance considerations critical in financial operations. This project will highlight concurrency skills.

* **Financial Data Aggregator & Analytics:** Creating Python-based tools to fetch, store, and analyze financial data from public APIs (e.g., stock prices, cryptocurrency). This showcases data handling, API consumption, and potential for basic insights.

* **Distributed Cache Implementation (Conceptual):** Exploring principles of system design and performance optimization by implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed cache (Go or Java). This demonstrates understanding of caching mechanisms crucial for high-performance systems.

* **Modern Portfolio Website (Completed):**
    * Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
    * Features smooth animations using Framer Motion.
    * Responsive design with dark mode.
    * Contact form integration with EmailJS.
